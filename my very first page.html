        This is my very first webside and I'm <b>extremely excited!!!!</b>

            when it comes to governance across the continent however the headlines can be less encouraging.
            In the last few weeks alone, we have seen evidence of corruption and lack of transparency in 
            sevel african nations, while huge anti-corruption rallies have been taking place. 
            Naming and shaming those involved in corruption is important; laws must be enforced and rule-breakers must
            be punished. This is an essential part of the proccess of governance and efforts to build trust between those
            in power and citizens.

        It is no secret that President of countries in Africa are viewed as being corrupt.<br><br><br>

        <b>But we should also be naming and faming those leaders</b><br>
        <i>with integrity- across governments, companies and civil society</i><br>
        <u>same way we celebrate the best rappers or footballers. After all these are unsung hereos that are literally saving lives</u><br>
        <em>making sure that health budgets are spent effectively,guaranteeing respect for workers right or going that extra mile to ensure
        all voices are heard as part of development programs</em><br>
        <strong>Many of these dictators are in power due to military coups and some continued
        to stay in power due to the proxy wars of the cold war</strong> 
        <hr>
        Even as the outright corruption was obvious inflation skyrockecketed and 
        humanitarian groups were unable to function,<a href="https://www.google.com"target="blank">these leaders were unable to function, these leaders were able to stay in power due to
        brutual regime.</a>  Unfortunately this list is far from comprehensive as there are many other African leaders that can be considered just
        as bad or worse depending on your criteria. Good governance is gainining ground in Africa. its happening at snails speed, but its heppening
        nevertheless. African leaders are becoming increasingly democratic and are recording significant progress in liberalizing the political 
        envornment they are more accountable to their citizens and showing more respect for haman rights and civil liberties.
